Welcome to my GitHub! I use this space to share college coursework, practice projects, and my ongoing journey in cybersecurity and digital forensics. Here, you'll find assignments in networking, Python scripting, and Linux system security as I build a foundation for a future in law enforcement cybersecurity and forensic analysis.

# About Me
My name is Anjeli Pancholi, and I've been passionate about computers since I was seven years old, when I first started playing video games with my brother. That early fascination sparked a lifelong interest in technology and set me on a path toward a career in computing.

I'm currently studying computer science with a focus on cybersecurity and digital forensics. My goal is to work in cybersecurity within law enforcement, where I can combine my passion for justice and protecting others with my technical skills. Iâ€™m especially interested in using technology to support the greater good, whether through forensic investigation, ethical hacking, or building tools that help keep people safe.

## My Interests
My hobbies include playing video games, working on personal projects and exploring nature. My academic interests are mainly centered around computer science and cybersecurity. Other personal interests I have are travelling and learning new languages.
